# Text_Analysis_Final_Feng
This repo is for the final project of the course Into to Text Analysis in Python <br>

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) plays a critical role in displaying the policymakersâ€™ consideration of U.S. monetary policy, and its releases are always scrutinized word by word by market participants to interpret the direction of interest rates or other economic measures. Its contents often influence the equity market, exchange rate, and credit swap market significantly. However, while qualitative interpretations abound, few studies have applied quantitative or computational methods to analyze these press releases systematically.

The goal of this project is to utilize computational tools to analyze (1) ** the FOMC policy statement** and (2) minutes to identify patterns in the language that could signal incoming monetary policy actions. Specifically, I aim to answer the following research question:
Can changes in the language and tone of FOMC press releases imply future policy interest rate changes?

This repository includes the following documents:
1. the ipynb document recording the text writing and coding of the final project (please check final_project.ipynb)
2. dataset of the interest rates record (2 of them in total)

Moreover, in order to check how many words in the markdown cell, I used Grammarly to check the word count and grammar. There are over 2000 words in texts

To Professor and TA:<br>
It is my great pleasure to have the chance of taking this course. ^_^ This project will display parts of content that I learned from the course. For me, this is a new way of exploring public policy totally. <br>
Thank you so much!
