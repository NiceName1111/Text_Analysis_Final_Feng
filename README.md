# Text_Analysis_Final_Feng
This repo is for the final project of the course Into to Text Analysis in Python <br>

It includes the following documents:
1. the ipynb document recording the text writing and coding of the final project (please check final_project.ipynb)
2. dataset of the interest rates record (2 of them in total)

Moreover, in order to check how many words in the markdown cell, I used Grammarly to check the word count and grammar. There are over 2000 words in texts

To Professor and TA:<br>
It is my great pleasure to have the chance of taking this course. ^_^ This project will display parts of content that I learned from the course. For me, this is a new way of exploring public policy totally. <br>
Thank you so much!
